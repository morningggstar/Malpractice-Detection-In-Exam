# Malpractice-Detection-In-Exam
This project develops a computer vision-based model to detect malpractice during examinations. The dataset consists of images categorized into different classes, representing normal behavior and cheating behavior. A custom PyTorch pipeline is implemented for data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, and classification.
